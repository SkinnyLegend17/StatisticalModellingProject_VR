# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
My goal for this project is to better understand and apply all my knowledge of python and statistical modelling. The purpose of this project is to apply this knowledge by utilizing the City Bikes API to retrieve information of bike stations within the City of our choice, and the various POI's within a location. 

## Process
### (your step 1)
- First connected to the City Bikes API and retrieve all available bike stations in that city (city of choice is Barcelona).
- For each bike station, use the API to call the latitude, longitude and number of bikes within the city
- Parse through the results and put into a Pandas dataframe.
### (your step 2)
- Connect to Foursquare and Yelp API to send requests
- For each of the bike stations, query both APIs to retrieve information for the restaurants, bars, and various POIs (points of interest) of your choice
- Create a DataFrame for the Yelp results and Foursquare results.
- Compare the results from Foursquare and Yelp

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
